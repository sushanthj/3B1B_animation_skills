# Production Quality Checklist

## 1. Text Overlap Prevention

**Rule: buff >= 0.5 for edge text**
```python
# BAD
label.to_edge(DOWN, buff=0.3)
# GOOD
label.to_edge(DOWN, buff=0.5)
```

**Rule: FadeOut previous bottom text before adding new**
```python
# BAD: overlapping bottom text
self.play(Write(note1))
self.play(Write(note2))  # overlaps note1!

# GOOD
self.play(ReplacementTransform(note1, note2))
# or
self.play(FadeOut(note1))
self.play(Write(note2))
```

**Rule: Reduce font size for dense scenes** -- use LABEL_SIZE (22-24) not BODY_SIZE (30-32) for annotations when many elements are present.

**Rule: Use arrange() / arrange_in_grid() for groups**
```python
# BAD: manual grid positioning
for i in range(16):
    sq.move_to(RIGHT * (i % 4) + DOWN * (i // 4))

# GOOD
grid = VGroup(*[Square() for _ in range(16)])
grid.arrange_in_grid(4, 4, buff=0.05)
```

**Rule: Labels go next_to their target object, not floating at absolute coords.**

## 2. Spatial Layout System

Frame: 14.2 wide x 8 tall, centered at ORIGIN.
Safe bounds: x: [-6.5, 6.5], y: [-3.5, 3.5].

### Named Layout Regions

Partition the screen into regions. Place elements INTO regions, not at arbitrary coordinates.

```
+--------------------------------------------------+
|  TITLE_REGION: y=[2.8, 3.5], full width           |
|--------------------------------------------------|
|  MAIN_LEFT          |  MAIN_RIGHT                  |
|  x=[-6.5, -0.5]    |  x=[0.5, 6.5]               |
|  y=[-2.0, 2.5]     |  y=[-2.0, 2.5]              |
|         MAIN_CENTER: x=[-5, 5], y=[-2, 2.5]       |
|--------------------------------------------------|
|  BOTTOM_REGION: y=[-3.5, -2.5], full width        |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

**Define in style.py:**
```python
TITLE_Y = 3.0
MAIN_CENTER = ORIGIN + DOWN * 0.2
LEFT_PANEL = LEFT * 3.5
RIGHT_PANEL = RIGHT * 3.5
BOTTOM_Y = -3.2
SAFE_WIDTH = 12.0   # max width for any element
SAFE_HEIGHT = 6.0   # max height for content area
```

### Coordinate Budget Rule

Never use absolute coordinates > 5.5 in x or > 3.2 in y. `shift(RIGHT * 6)` = likely clipped.

```python
# BAD
signal_bar.shift(RIGHT * 6.5 + DOWN * 0.5)
# GOOD: relative positioning
signal_bar.next_to(zoomed_box, RIGHT, buff=0.3)
# GOOD: clamp
x_pos = min(pos, 6.0)
```

### Fill-the-Frame Rule

Visible content should occupy >= 50% of frame area. Fix sparse content by scaling up, adding context, or using full width.

### Dual-Panel Layout

```python
left_panel.move_to(LEFT * 3.2)
right_panel.move_to(RIGHT * 3.2)
divider = DashedLine(UP * 2.5, DOWN * 2.5, color=DIMMED)
```

## 3. Container Boundary Enforcement

Elements inside a container MUST fit within its bounds.

**Rule: Position children relative to the container**
```python
# BAD
container = Rectangle(width=4, height=3).shift(RIGHT * 2)
label = Text("Hello").shift(RIGHT * 5)  # outside!

# GOOD
label = Text("Hello").move_to(container.get_center() + UP * 0.5)
label = Text("Hello").next_to(container.get_top(), DOWN, buff=0.3)
```

**Rule: Scale-to-fit when content might overflow**
```python
if eq.width > container.width - 0.4:
    eq.scale_to_fit_width(container.width - 0.4)
```

**Rule: Cap text width (add safe_text to style.py)**
```python
def safe_text(text: str, max_width: float = 12.0, **kwargs) -> Text:
    """Create text that fits within max_width."""
    t = Text(text, **kwargs)
    if t.width > max_width:
        t.scale_to_fit_width(max_width)
    return t
```

Use for ALL body text and bottom notes (default: 12.0; bottom notes: ~13.0 with 0.5 margin each side).

## 4. Data Visualization Minimums

```python
bar_width >= 0.3       # narrower bars invisible at 720p
bar_height >= 0.2      # shorter bars vanish
fill_opacity >= 0.6    # data elements (bars, dots, areas)
fill_opacity >= 0.3    # background/container elements
stroke_opacity >= 0.8  # lines and borders
dot_radius >= 0.06     # smaller dots vanish at 720p
axes_width >= 5.0      # chart axes >= 40% of frame width
```

## 5. Persistent Element Lifecycle

**Rule: FadeOut titles before reusing their screen region**
```python
# BAD
self.play(pipeline.animate.to_edge(UP))  # overlaps title!

# GOOD
self.play(FadeOut(title), run_time=0.3)
self.play(pipeline.animate.to_edge(UP))
```

**Rule: Track what is on screen.** Before placing a new element, check: "Is anything already in this region?" If yes, FadeOut or move it first.

### Multi-Element Scenes

```python
# always_redraw: geometry changes shape (different endpoints, curves)
curve = always_redraw(lambda: axes.plot(func, ...))

# add_updater: only position/value changes
label.add_updater(lambda m: m.set_value(tracker.get_value()))

# frozen_frame=False during updater sections
self.wait(2, frozen_frame=False)
```

### Scene Length Guidelines

No maximum scene length. Write as much code as the scene needs.
- Simple reveal: 50-100 lines | Parameter sweep: 150-250 lines
- Dual view: 200-300 lines | Full visual proof: 250-350 lines

The 300-line limit applies to SKILL DOCUMENTATION files, not animation code.

## 6. Agent Prompt Requirements

When delegating scene writing to subagents, the prompt MUST include:

1. **Exact paper metadata**: copy exact title, author list, year (never let agents guess)
2. **Alignment**: "Ensure all shapes, labels, annotations are aligned. No flipped/mirrored shapes."
3. **Container rule**: "Elements inside containers must fit within bounds. Use relative positioning."
4. **Lifecycle rule**: "FadeOut persistent elements before new content occupies their region."
5. **Screen bounds**: "All elements fully visible within x:[-7,7] y:[-3.5,3.5]. Scale long text to fit."

## 7. Pre-Render Checklist

1. Every text element has a clear position (not default center)
2. Bottom text uses buff >= 0.5
3. Previous bottom text is FadeOut before new text appears
4. Groups use arrange() not manual positioning
5. Labels are next_to their target object
6. All mobjects cleaned up (FadeOut) before next logical section
7. Updaters use frozen_frame=False during wait()
8. Large font text (TITLE_SIZE) scaled down after reveal
9. Child elements fit within parent container bounds
10. No absolute-coordinate elements overflowing containers
11. Persistent titles FadeOut before new content reuses their space
12. Bottom notes width-capped to ~13 Manim units
13. No absolute coordinates > 5.5 in x or > 3.2 in y
14. Content fills >= 50% of the frame (no large dead zones)
15. Data viz bars/dots/lines meet minimum size and opacity thresholds

## 8. Dimming on Dark Backgrounds

**Rule: DIM_OPACITY = 0.1, never 0.3**

On dark backgrounds (#1e1e2e or similar), elements at 0.3 opacity still compete with primary content. Use 0.1 for aggressive dimming that actually works.

```python
DIM_OPACITY = 0.1  # 0.3 is too visible on dark backgrounds

def dim_mob(scene, *mobs, opacity=DIM_OPACITY):
    scene.play(*[m.animate.set_opacity(opacity) for m in mobs], run_time=0.5)
```

When even 0.1 is too much, use `FadeOut` instead of dimming.

## 9. Text Width Enforcement

Manim has NO auto-wrap. Long text will overflow the screen silently.

**Rule: Break all text manually with `\n`**
```python
# BAD: will overflow right edge
Text("This is a very long sentence that explains a complex mathematical concept")

# GOOD: manually broken
Text("This is a very long sentence\nthat explains a complex\nmathematical concept")
```

**Rule: Use safe_text() for all body text**
```python
def safe_text(text: str, max_width: float = 12.0, **kwargs) -> Text:
    t = Text(text, **kwargs)
    if t.width > max_width:
        t.scale_to_fit_width(max_width)
    return t
```

**Rule: Labels near mobjects use font_size <= 18 and short strings (< 30 chars)**

## 10. Only Animate What Visualizes Well

**Rule: If a concept needs explanation before the viewer can understand what they're looking at, choose a different visual.**

Good visuals (self-explanatory):
- Long division showing remainder cycles
- Polygons converging to a circle
- Function plots with shaded areas
- Number lines with marked points
- Side-by-side comparisons

Bad visuals (require narration to decode):
- Abstract coordinate mappings the viewer hasn't seen before
- Wrapping a number line around a circle to "show" irrationality
- Phase space diagrams without buildup
- Any visualization where the axes need explaining first

The test: "Would a first-time viewer understand this visual within 3 seconds of seeing it?"

## 11. Scene Transitions

**Rule: Add connective tissue between scenes**
```python
# Bridge text between scenes
def bridge(scene, text, wait=2.0):
    t = Text(text, font_size=28, color=YELLOW)
    scene.play(FadeIn(t, shift=UP * 0.3))
    scene.wait(wait)
    scene.play(FadeOut(t, shift=UP * 0.3))
```

Use bridge text at act boundaries ("But what does irrational actually mean?") to prevent abrupt jumps.

**Rule: End every scene with fade_all()**
```python
def fade_all(scene, run_time=0.8):
    scene.play(*[FadeOut(m) for m in scene.mobjects], run_time=run_time)
```

## 12. Visual Variety Audit

**Rule: No two consecutive scenes should use the same visual technique.**

Count the distinct visual techniques across all scenes. If > 50% of scenes are "labeled boxes + text," the video will feel flat. Each scene must use at least ONE of:
- `ValueTracker` + `always_redraw` (live updating values)
- `MovingCameraScene` (zoom in/out)
- `interpolate_color` heatmap or gradient
- `Axes` + `plot` (data visualization)
- `BarChart` or manual bar chart with `GrowFromEdge`
- `LaggedStart` with staggered reveals
- Equation dim-and-reveal decomposition

**Minimum variety for an N-scene video:**
- N <= 4: at least 3 distinct techniques
- N = 5-8: at least 5 distinct techniques
- N > 8: at least 6 distinct techniques

**The test:** List each scene and its primary visual technique. If you see "labeled_box pipeline" more than twice, replace one with a live data flow, a heatmap, or a camera zoom.

## 13. Question Frame Minimum

**Rule: At least one question frame per 3 scenes.**

A question frame (catalog pattern #15) poses a question on screen, pauses 2-3 seconds for the viewer to predict, then answers visually. Without them, the viewer is passive. With them, the viewer actively engages.

For an 8-scene video: include at least 2-3 question frames.

```python
# Question frame template
question = Text("Can a small patch of cortex\noutperform surface electrodes?",
                font_size=28, color=YELLOW)
self.play(Write(question))
self.wait(2.5)  # viewer predicts
self.play(FadeOut(question))
# Then show the answer visually (bar chart, number, etc.)
```

## 14. Density Ramp Audit

**Rule: Frame complexity must increase across the video.**

Count the number of visible elements at each scene's midpoint:
- Scene 1-2: 3-5 elements (sparse, inviting)
- Scene 3-5: 6-10 elements (building complexity)
- Scene 6-7: 10-15 elements (peak density)
- Final scene: 3-5 elements (resolution, simplicity)

This creates a narrative arc in visual density. Constant density (every scene has 6 elements) feels monotonous. Starting dense overwhelms.

## 15. Post-Render Checklist

1. No text overlapping other text
2. No text overlapping graphical elements
3. No elements extending off screen
4. Timing feels natural (not too fast, not too slow)
5. Every animation adds meaning (no decorative motion)
6. Equations appear AFTER their visual motivation
7. Author names and paper metadata are correct
8. Visual variety: at least 5 distinct techniques across scenes
9. At least 2 question frames in the video
10. Density ramp: early scenes sparse, middle dense, ending simple
11. At least one scene uses ValueTracker/always_redraw for live values
12. Pipeline scenes show data transforming, not just dots sliding
